- [x] changing route can access super admin page when logged in as node admin
- [x] item transit can be created for an item that is already in transit    
- [x] item transit source node should only show the node of the item
- [ ] item transit should link to the QR of the item
- [x] qr create page should be able to choose any node as source
- [ ] the item instance should be the node inventory, adding and subtracting from there
- [x] add loading animation when changing menus/pages, especially in the super admin dashboard (a little buggy)
- [ ] make a show qr code button in the super admin item transit page
- [ ] make it when an item is in the item transit table, the node in the item instance is "in transit"
- [ ] make the navbac for the superadmin and node admin also have qr create, and make it when clicking the logo, it redirect to the dashboard (super-admin/ or node-admin/ not dashboard/)

low priority:

- [ ] when the destination node when the qr is created and when the qr is scanned do not match, it should be handled
- [ ] when scanning a qr, the pop up should be more descriptive about what is happening
