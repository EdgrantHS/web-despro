- changing route can access super admin page when logged in as node admin
- item transit can be created for an item that is already in transit    
- item transit source node should only show the node of the item
- item transit should link to the QR of the item
- qr create page should be able to choose any node as source
- the item instance should be the node inventory, adding and subtracting from there

low priority:

- when the destination node when the qr is created and when the qr is scanned do not match, it should be handled
- when scanning a qr, the pop up should be more descriptive about what is happening

alredy implemented i think

- creating an item transit should remove the item from the source node's inventory
- completing an item transit should add the item to the destination node's inventory
