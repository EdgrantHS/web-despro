## Progress Update Meeting 1 - 2025/09/07

> AI generated based on audio recording, and then manually edited

- *Recording*: https://audio.com/edgrant/audio/despro-meeting-1
- *Attendees*: Edgrant, Haris, Other participants
- *Topic*: Project Planning and Technical Discussion for Despro Project
- *Summary*: The meeting covered current development progress on QR scanning, front-end and back-end architectural decisions for Next.js, a discussion on necessary hardware (QR scanner, printer), an project timeline split into phases, and strategies for task division and parallel work. Key decisions were made regarding API structure and initial tasks for the first two weeks.

- *Discussion Points*
  - **Current Development Progress & Front-End Aspects**
    - The team reported successful implementation of QR scanning to capture images and convert them to Base64 format.
    - The Base64 string can already be converted into text.
    - A significant challenge remains in converting the Base64 string into JSON format for database upload.
    - There is exploration into finding a method to directly convert QR code scans into JSON, which would be more efficient.
    - The front-end dev is also responsible for building the UI and connecting to APIs.
    - Initial front-end tasks for Phase 1 include developing the login page and the QR scan page.

  - **Back-End Architecture & API Design**
    - The project uses Next.js, where pages are `page.tsx` files and APIs are typically handled via `route.ts` files.
    - A best practice for processing QR code strings is to use a dedicated back-end API route designed to receive the string and handle database operations (e.g., uploading JSON).
    - There was a discussion on whether to create helper functions within a page's API or to establish dedicated API routes with their own URLs for complex logic.
    - The consensus was to create **specific API routes** with URLs for functions like receiving QR strings and processing them, rather than embedding helper functions directly within a page's API handler. This approach allows for external calls and better task division.
    - For a full-stack framework like Next.js, both front-end and back-end can reside in the same repository.
    - Front-end components will call these internal APIs, passing necessary data (e.g., the scanned string).
    - Phase 1 back-end tasks include creating APIs for login (returning node information) and handling the QR scan string (processing, removing/adding items from database).
    - The initial database schema needs to include `item`, `node`, `user`, `transit`, `item type`, and `item instance` tables, which can be hardcoded initially if not fully implemented.
    - An admin dashboard UI is planned for a later phase.

  - **Hardware Requirements & Integration**
    - The possibility of using a phone camera as the "hardware" was discussed, but the preference is for a dedicated physical hardware component.
    - NFC was suggested as an alternative to QR scanning, though experience with it is limited.
    - The team decided to explore acquiring both a **QR scanner** and a **printer** (for QR code generation) to fulfill the hardware requirement.
    - The budget for hardware is IDR 2,000,000, and a method for reimbursement will be established.
    - It's crucial that the hardware can be **controlled and integrated with code** (e.g., through APIs) rather than relying on a separate application.
    - Barcode scanners typically integrate easily by acting as keyboard input, and it needs to be confirmed if QR code scanners function similarly.

  - **Project Scope, Goals & Timeline**
    - The team debated whether to aim for a basic "pass" or a "good" project suitable for a portfolio, ultimately deciding to aim for a **high-quality project**.
    - The project timeline is set for **3 months** (September, October, November), with a workshop in October, leaving 12 weeks for development.
    - **Phase 1 (Week 1-2, by end of September):**
        - Hardcode two nodes and two users for initial testing.
        - Test QR scanning to ensure item modification (remove/add) works.
        - Develop login page and QR scan page (front-end).
        - Create core database tables: `item`, `node`, `user`, `transit`, `item type`, `item instance` (can be hardcoded if necessary).
        - Develop backend APIs for login and handling scan strings.
    - **Phase 2 (Week 3):**
        - Implement QR code generation.
        - Integrate the hardware.
    - **Phase 3:**
        - Implement user and node creation.
        - Develop transit management features.
        - Ensure user login correctly validates against the appropriate node.
    - **Phase 4:**
        - To be planned.
    - The plan aims for project completion by mid-November, followed by reviewing and additional features.

  - **Team Workflow & Task Division**
    - To facilitate parallel work and clear responsibilities, the team decided to **separate front-end UI development from back-end logic**.
    - Front-end developers will focus on UI and calling APIs, while back-end developers will handle the logic and database interactions.
    - Complex processing, like handling QR scan strings and updating multiple tables, will be encapsulated in dedicated API routes.
    - This division ensures that tasks are assigned per file or module, preventing multiple people from working on the same file and simplifying task allocation for reporting purposes.
    - The front-end can proceed with calling internal APIs, assuming they will work, allowing parallel development while the back-end APIs are being developed.

- *Action Items*:
  - PM
    - [ ] Research and find a way to convert Base64 strings to JSON, or directly convert QR code scans to JSON.

## Progress Update Meeting 2 - 2025/09/14

- *Recording*: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IrVAhSz-JMxCaXaoHoIXfOkRtuY742MD/view?usp=drive_link
- *Attendees*: Edgrant, Haris, Nadhif, Bima
- *Topic*: Progress Review (Fase 1), Hardware Procurement Strategy, Development Strategy, and Timeline Adjustment.
- *Summary*: The team reviewed initial progress on hardware selection for the QR scanner and addressed the difficulty in sourcing a suitable printer. Development tasks for Phase 1 (Login and QR Scan) were finalized and assigned. A critical discussion on Git branching strategy ensued, recommending individual branches to avoid conflicts. The development target date of the Oktober 17th was maintained, but a buffer period until the 19th was added for testing.

- *Discussion Points*
  - **Hardware Procurement and Functionality**
    - The QR scanner hardware has been identified and is priced at Rp 540k.
    - This scanner connects to a computer via a cable and can read the barcode/QR code directly, similar to systems used in locations like Partek.
    - Difficulty remains in finding a suitable printer, especially one that can convert a code into a printable barcode/QR code.
    - Most available options are currently only portable printers.
    - The requirement for the printer is primarily to print the QR code image itself, preferably using a sticker printer. The hardware requirement is intended to be simple, serving mainly to fulfill project requirements.
    - The QR scanner has not yet been ordered, as the team needs to follow up with the seller for more detailed questions.
    - Searching for specific hardware that links to local vendors (like Shopee or Tokped) is challenging; searches often return only the series number or lead to foreign commerce sites.
  - **Phase 1 Development and Git Strategy**
    - Stage 1 development focuses on completing the **Login** and **Scan** functionalities.
    - Figma designs are mostly complete, though a few parts are still unfinished.
    - When cloning the repository, developers must ensure they are working on the `phase-1` branch, rather than the `main` branch, to avoid errors.
    - To prevent conflicts or issues requiring constant pulling, Haris and Nadhif are advised to create their own feature branches, cloning from `phase-1`.
  - **Task Allocation and User Roles**
    - **Nadhif** is assigned the Front-End (FE) and Back-End (BE) implementation for the **Login** functionality.
    - **Haris** (Ris) is assigned the Front-End (FE) and Back-End (BE) implementation for the **QR Scan** functionality.
    - **Nadhif** needs to explore **Supabase**, as the login system published uses `out user ID`.
      - The login process must accommodate three user types: Petugas, Admin Node, and Admin Pusat
      - The user database table currently only stores role data and node data.
      - A decision must be made whether to implement detailed privilege levels or simplify roles into general categories (e.g., *petugas admin*, *note*, and *admin pusat*).
  - **Timeline and Scheduling**
    - The development target completion date remains the **17th**.
    - A buffer period is added until the **19th** to ensure adequate time for testing before the subsequent meeting review, aiming for a completed Phase 1.

- *Action Items*:
  - Nadhif:
    - [ ] Work on the FE and BE implementation for the **Login** functionality.
    - [ ] Explore and familiarize self with **Supabase**, specifically concerning the login mechanism.
    - [ ] Create a separate branch for feature development, checked out from `phase-1`.
  - Haris:
    - [ ] Work on the FE and BE implementation for the **QR Scan** functionality.
    - [ ] Continue searching online for references/implementations of similar systems, particularly focusing on Indonesian server resources.
    - [ ] Create a separate branch for feature development, checked out from `phase-1`.
  - Bima
    - [ ] Follow up with the seller to confirm detailed specifications and mechanism of the QR scanner connection before placing an order.
    - [ ] Search for a suitable printer (preferably a sticker printer) capable of printing basic QR codes.
  - Development Team
    - [ ] Ensure development targets Phase 1 completion by the **17th**.
    - [ ] Determine the final structure for user privileges (detailed vs. general roles).

## Progress Update Meeting 3 - 2025/09/21

- *Recording*: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qSMf3u4plE5czovOfV2_Hb1tA1iX0Sth/view?usp=sharing
- *Attendees*: Edgrant, Haris, Bima, and Nadhif
- *Topic*: Login & Authentication Progress, QR Scan API Implementation Flow, Hardware Procurement Status, and Next Steps.
- *Summary*: The team reviewed the progress on the Login page authentication, which uses Supabase but relies on a separate `user` table for role and node management. A significant portion of the meeting defined the complex logic for the QR Scan function, focusing on the `item transit` flow, where scanning dictates whether an item is being sent (creating a new active transit record) or received (soft-deleting/inactivating an active transit record). Bima updated the team on the hardware (scanner and printer), pending approval from Pak Alfan. The overall project timeline was shifted back by one week, and the next meeting with Pak Alfan is tentatively planned for the first two weeks of October.

- *Discussion Points*
  - **Login Page & Authentication**
    - The front-end (FE) progress for the login page is complete, although the visual styling is not finalized.
    - _Authentication utilizes Supabase, but the system should not rely solely on Supabase for user role and node management._
    - Supabase is used primarily for verifying email and password validity.
    - **User Role and Node Data:** Crucial user data, specifically the assigned node (`node ID`) and role (e.g., 'petugas' or 'admin'), is stored in a separate `user` table.
    - **Login Flow:** After Supabase verifies the credentials, the backend queries the `user` table to retrieve the associated Node ID and Role.
    - _**Table Structure:** Currently there is no roles column in the `user` table, there is many boolean columns indicating privileges. For simplicity, Edgrant suggested having a single `role` column with values like 'petugas' or 'admin'._
    - The `user ID` in the custom `user` table must correspond exactly to the `user ID` generated by Supabase authentication. It was suggested to remove unnecessary fields from the custom table.
    - **Security Note:** While a best practice is to separate admin and regular user tables to mitigate risk if a user table is breached, this refinement is deferred until the project's end if time permits, and currently, all data is combined.

  - **QR Scan Implementation & API Flow**
    - **FE Progress (Haris):** Haris has successfully developed the front-end to scan a QR code, _When scanned, a string formatted as JSON can be sent_. The system can parse this string into a JSON object ready for transmission to the API. He noted that a separate base URL was not required, as the QR code itself directly holds the JSON string.
    - **API Design:** The team decided that processing should be handled primarily through one endpoint (`QR code data`) which analyzes the data in the string to determine if an item is being sent or received.
    - **Core API Structure:** Basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) APIs exist for core objects: `Node`, `Item Type`, `Item Instance`, and `Transit`.
    - **Item Instance vs. Item Transit:** An `Item Instance` refers to a specific physical item (e.g., one box of Indomie goreng). An `Item Transit` records the movement of an item instance between nodes (source node and destination node).
    - **Item Transit Flow Logic:**
      - The item movement is tracked across four main steps: departing the warehouse, arriving at the kitchen, departing the kitchen, and arriving at the school.
      - Scanning an item requires checking the `item transit` table for any *active* transit record associated with that item instance.
      - **If Active Transit Exists:** Scanning means the item has arrived at the destination node, and the transit record must be made *inactive* (soft delete).
      - **If No Active Transit Exists:** Scanning means the item is being sent (e.g., from the gudang), and a *new* transit record must be created, setting its status to *active*.
      - **New Movements:** Every movement of an item from one node to the next (even if it's the same item instance) requires creating a **new** item transit record.
      - **Item Processing:** If an item is fundamentally changed (e.g., raw ingredients become cooked meals), it becomes a different `item instance`.
      - **Data Preservation:** Deactivating a transit record (upon arrival) is done using a soft delete mechanism to ensure historical data is retained.
      - Error Handling: _Implement error handling can be done to verify that the item instance exists in the database. This is a lower priority task and can be deferred if time is limited._

  - **Hardware Procurement Status**
    - _Bima has found but not purchased the equipment, pending approval after consultation with Pak Alfan._
    - **QR/Barcode Scanner:** Estimated cost is 600,000 IDR. It can scan QR codes but only outputs the raw number or string, which is ideal for integration with QR scanning FE on a laptop. 
    - **Printer:** Recommended printer costs 850,000 IDR. It uses thermal printing (inkless) and can connect via Bluetooth. The layout can be customized via the 'label app'.
    - **Printer Capabilities:** The printer cannot be controlled via code; it only receives print jobs.
    - Total estimated cost for both items is approximately 1.3 million IDR.

  - **Timeline and Next Steps**
    - The overall project timeline has been moved back by one week.
    - Internal meetings will be held every Sunday.
    - A meeting with Pak Alfan is planned for two weeks later (tentatively between October 6th and 10th) to discuss the purchase of hardware.
      - _After meeting notes: Online Meeting is scheduled for October 8th at 16:00 WIB_

- *Action Items*:
  - Nadhif:
    - [ ] Refine the `user` table structure to align `user ID` with Supabase authentication and remove redundant columns.
  - Haris:
    - [ ] Develop the backend API logic for QR scanning, ensuring correct identification of sending (creating active transit) or receiving (soft-deleting/inactivating active transit) based on item transit status.
  - Edgrant:
    - [x] Coordinate and schedule the online meeting with Pak Alfan (targeting early October) to discuss hardware procurement.
  - Bima:
    - [ ] Prepare for the meeting with Pak Alfan to discuss and finalize the hardware purchases (scanner and printer).

## Progress Update Meeting 4 - 2025/09/28

- *Recording*: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bNskItPOfTmgZ717433bddmBYf5oVaQG/view?usp=sharing
- *Attendees*: Edgrant, Haris, Nadhif
- *Topic*: Phase 1 Progress Review (QR Scan & Auth Integration) and Phase 2 Planning (Admin Pages & QR Generation)
- *Summary*: The meeting primarily focused on Haris's update regarding Phase 1 QR Scan functionality, where the backend logic is complete, but a critical front-end issue remains in parsing the QR code string (which contains JSON) into a usable JSON object. The team then planned Phase 2, which involves three new pages: Item Instance Admin, Superadmin CRUD page, and QR Generation. Haris was assigned the QR Generation feature. Phase 2 is targeted for completion before October 5th. Hardware procurement is pending a proposal to Pak Alfan.

- *Discussion Points*
  - **Phase 1 Progress: Authentication Integration**
    - Nadhif has not yet completed the task of integrating the authentication publish with the new user table. This relates to the Phase 1 requirement to manage user role and node data in a custom `user` table alongside Supabase authentication.
  - **Phase 1 Progress: QR Scan Functionality**
    - The backend API for the QR scan functionality is successfully returning responses.
    - **Critical Frontend Issue:** A problem exists on the frontend (FE) where the string received from the QR code (which is meant to contain JSON data) cannot be successfully parsed into a JSON object, currently resulting in "undefined" data. This appears to be a front-end algorithmic issue. This parsing issue currently prevents testing with the actual camera/QR code.
    - **Backend Logic Confirmation:** Haris demonstrated the backend flow: if a QR code is new, the system creates a new active item instance; if the QR code already exists, the system updates the item instance from active to inactive, indicating the item has arrived at a node. This logic aligns with the previous definition that scanning an existing active transit record should inactivate it.
  - **QR Scan Edge Cases**
    - The team discussed the need to handle accidental double scanning by the sending node.
    - If a QR code is already marked as in transit, and the source node (the same node that sent it) scans it again, it should have no effect. This check should be performed based on the source node.
    - Handling this double-scan case is a secondary priority.
  - **Phase 2 Planning: New Pages**
    - Phase 2 will introduce three new pages: a Superadmin CRUD page, an Item Instance Admin page, and a QR Generation page.
    - **Item Instance Admin Page:** This page allows for the administration of item instances. It requires specialized APIs to handle filtering nodes for URL creation. The Figma design for this page is currently not available.
    - **Super admin CRUD Page:** This page should allow easy administration using buttons for 'add new item', 'edit', and 'delete'.
  - **Phase 2 Planning: QR Generation Page Logic**
    - The QR generation page is considered the most difficult page in Phase 2, as the others are mostly table-based.
    - **Input Requirements:** The page requires input for the item name.
    - **Item Name Logic:** When the user types the item name, additional logic is needed to suggest existing item names from a list (e.g., a search bar feature).
    - **Auto-Fill Data:** The origin/source node must be automatically filled based on the node of the logged-in user (admin node). The quantity/item count (`item count`) _will be auto filled according to the last item instance count_. The destination node is chosen by the user.
  - **Timeline and Scheduling**
    - The target for Phase 2 completion is before Sunday, which is before October 5th.
    - A meeting with Pak Alfan are scheduled for October 8th.
  - **Task Allocation**
    - Haris will take the QR generation task (which was part of the initial Phase 2 plan) to maintain continuity.

- *Action Items*:
  - Haris:
    - [ ] Resolve the front-end parsing issue preventing the QR code string (containing JSON) from being successfully converted into a JSON object.
    - [ ] Complete the integration of authentication publish with the new user table.
    - [ ] Start development on the QR Generation page (Phase 2), including the item name suggestion logic.
  - Bima:
    - [ ] Prepare a proposal (Eg. slides) for hardware procurement (scanner and printer) to present to Pak Alfan in the upcoming meeting.
  - Nadhif
    - [ ] Assist Haris with the front-end parsing issue if needed.
    - [ ] Complete the integration of authentication publish with the new user table.
    - [ ] Work on the item instance admin and super CRUD admin pages.
  - Edgrant
    - [ ] (Secondary Priority) Implement logic to handle the case where the source node accidentally scans an item twice.
    - [ ] End to end testing of Phase 1 

## Bimbingan Despro - 2025/10/08

- *Recording*: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FSiYzLg9yrHMg3VJ8rBBeL6hXHvp206x/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FSiYzLg9yrHMg3VJ8rBBeL6hXHvp206x/view?usp=sharing)
 - *Attendees*: Edgrant: Group 13 representative, Pak Alfan (advisor/supervisor)
- *Topic*: Project Development Update (Group 13), Financial/Reimbursement Policy, Budget Optimization, and Presentation Strategy. 
- *Summary*: Pak Alfan (supervisor) provided guidelines regarding the one-month reimbursement deadline, budget optimization beyond technical components (focusing on packaging, presentation, and services like soldering), and a strong emphasis on presentation quality and audience engagement. Group 13 presented an update on their logistics system using QR scanning, noted they are one week behind schedule but within buffer, and plan to prioritize purchasing a scanner. The speaker stressed the need for Group 13 to clarify their **unique value proposition** and **business process flow** for the demonstration.

- *Discussion Points*
  - **Reimbursement and Finance Policy**
    - The maximum period for **reimbursement** of purchased items is **one month** from the purchase date. Purchases made past this deadline **cannot be reimbursed**.
    - It is strongly advised to **expedite the purchase** of necessary equipment, especially items with consequences like long lead times (**inden**) or long shipping waits, to avoid development delays.
    - If a service, such as professional soldering, is hired, a formal receipt (**kuitansi**) must be created and signed by the service provider as proof of transaction for reimbursement.
  - **Budget Optimization and Utilization**
    - The utilization of the maximum $\text{2,000,000}$ budget in previous years was not optimal. Groups should **optimize** their budget utilization.
    - Budget should be allocated beyond just technical components, specifically for **packaging** and **presentation** to make the final product more convincing. Examples include:
      - Tidy up the prototype (e.g., replacing messy cabling/jumpers).
      - Designing and creating a tidy enclosure (e.g., via **3D printing** for a box).
      - Using services for professional **soldering** and neat wiring.
      - Creating visual aids for the presentation, such as a **poster** or **standing banner** that explains the product's function and mechanism.
  - **Group 13 Project Update (Logistics System with QR)**
    - **Concept:** Creating a logistics system using **QR scanning** as the main functionality for inventory transformation and access control (admin and user).
    - **Progress:** They are between Phase 2 and Phase 3, one week behind the initial timeline, but still within the buffer. Current features include QR scanning (currently hardcoded), API creation, and an admin dashboard. Integration between the various developer-created components is the next immediate step.
    - **Purchases:** They plan to purchase a **printer** ($\text{800,000}$) or a **scanner** ($\text{600,000}$). They prioritize the scanner because integrating the printer would require modifying the printer's proprietary application, making it more complex.
    - **Presentation Focus:** Group 13 intends to focus the demonstration on **inventory transformation** rather than inter-unit logistics. Their proposed demonstration concept is to simulate the **"cooking"** process, changing ingredients (like powder and cups) into a final product (like **Pop Ice**) to show the inventory update in the system.
    - **Technical/Presentation Concerns:** The speaker noted that QR scanning applications are common. Group 13 must clearly present **what is unique** about their solution and thoroughly explain the **business process flow**.
  - **Demonstration and Presentation Strategy**
    - The current evaluation emphasis is on **demonstration** and **audience engagement**, not just a written report.
    - Presentation must be **clear, convincing, and engaging** for people with limited time and potentially non-technical backgrounds.
    - **Visual aids** should be used, such as posters or standing banners, to illustrate the product's function, mechanism, or workflow.
    - Suggestions for improving the presentation:
      - Labeling the process during the demonstration (e.g., Process 1: Using the Phone, Process 2: System Update).
      - Creating a small, conceptual **demonstrator** (e.g., using toy cars/miniatures) to physically show the supply chain process.
      - Develop a **narrative/story** to frame the demonstration and explain the problem/solution (e.g., Pop Ice making as a simulation).
    - **Goal:** Make the presentation attractive, with a clear flow, so people can quickly understand the overall solution being offered.
    - **Next Step:** Plan an in-person, physical demonstration of the early prototype/UI with the instructor to discuss the demonstration flow and story.

- *Action Items*:
  - **All Groups**:
    - [ ] Expedite the purchase of all necessary components, especially those requiring a long lead or shipping time.
    - [ ] Ensure all reimbursement claims are submitted within **one month** of the purchase date.
  - **Group 13 (Edgrant)**:
    - [ ] Execute the next development step: **Integration** of all existing components/developer work.
    - [ ] Finalize the decision on purchasing the **scanner**, prioritizing the scanner based on current discussion.
      - _After the meeting, Purchase plan:_
        - _Scanner: $\text{600,000}$ _
        - _Banner: $\text{150,000}$ _
        - _Flyers: $\text{50,000}$ _
        - _Workshop food: $\text{500,000}$ _
        - _Miniature: $\text{500,000}$ _
        - _Emergency: $\text{200,000}$ _

    - [ ] Prepare visual aids (poster/standing banner) to clearly illustrate the **business process flow** and the **unique value proposition** of the QR-based logistics system.
    - [ ] Develop a clear **demonstration narrative/story** (e.g., the Pop Ice simulation) that focuses on inventory transformation.
    - [ ] Arrange an in-person meeting with the instructor to demonstrate the early prototype and discuss the presentation flow.

## QR Scan Feature Discussion - 2025/10/10-10

- *Recording*: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SNBnvazm1aD4RO4By-wADlSRQHbmGlbH/view?usp=sharing
- *Attendees*: Edgrant, Haris
- *Topic*: QR Scan Feature Development, Item Instance/Stock Management Logic, and Courier Data Flow
- *Summary*: The meeting focused on finalizing the logic for QR code generation, item instance tracking, and stock reduction functionality within the system. Key decisions involved determining when the stock count should decrease (upon first scan/shipment), refining the form workflow (Node selection before Item selection), and addressing the technical challenges of using dynamic URLs versus hardcoded ports for the QR API scan. The issue of capturing courier data efficiently was tabled for further discussion.

- *Discussion Points*

  - **QR Code Structure and Update Logic**
    - _The QR implementation has two pages: QR scan page and QR generation._
    - The QR is designed to **store only a string ID**.
    - This ID is combined with the API scan base URL to create the full URL for the item transit check.
    - When the QR is scanned, the system searches for the URL in `item transit`; if not found, a new entry is created; if found, the status is updated to active or inactive.
    - The QR code itself is created during the packaging phase.

  - **Item Instance and Stock Management**
    - The final decision is that **one item instance will represent stock**, meaning one instance entry is tied to one node.
    - The instance entry contain a `count` field.
    - If there is stock addition, the count is updated; a new row is not created. (This differs from a previous concept where a new entry was created for temporary stock ready to be shipped).
    - An item instance is tied to a specific item type for a specific node (e.g., Indomie Goreng at Node A). Different nodes can have the same item type, resulting in separate item instances.
    - The item count should **decrease only upon the first scan** (when it transitions from inactive to active/in-transit status).
    - Stock reduction occurs **during shipment (scanning)**, not during packaging (QR creation).
    - Handling is needed for situations where an item is selected but is not available in the source node.

  - **Workflow and Node Selection**
    - Originally, the filter for the source field only allowed 'source' type nodes, and the destination field only allowed 'distribution' type nodes.
    - _Both the source and destination fields should allow all types of nodes._
    - The agreed-upon sequence for the delivery form is to select the **Source node first, then the Destination node, and finally the Item Name**. The item list shown must be constrained by the selected source node.

  - **Courier Data and Scanning Process**
    - The initial plan involves the courier logging in, and their current account data (email, name, phone number, etc.) is automatically linked when they scan.
    - The person performing the scan is assumed to be the courier/delivery staff.
    - A complication arises if the scanner is not the person delivering, leading to a need to capture sender data without requiring manual input.
    - The detailed discussion regarding how to handle non-scanning couriers/sender data capture will be postponed until Sunday.

  - **API URL Configuration and Port Handling**
    - The API scan functionality was designed so that the QR URL equals the API URL, allowing it to be directly posted/accessed.
    - Currently, the API uses a hardcoded port (e.g., 3000) for development purposes.
    - **The issue with dynamic URLs:** If the port changes (e.g., from 3000 to 2020) after the QR is created, the system may fail to find the item in `item transit` because the full URL (which includes the port) is used in the search.
    - **Resolution:** The URL should only use the QR ID. For now, the system will use a hardcoded URL (3000). When a proper domain is acquired, the hardcoded value will be replaced with the domain name.

- *Action Items*:
  - Haris:
    - [ ] Reconfigure the form workflow so that node selection (Source and Destination) precedes item name selection.
    - [ ] _Change the item instance count when the QR is scanned: decrease the count only upon the first scan and increase it when the item is scanned on arrival._

  - Other:
    - [ ] Implement the logic for reducing the item count upon the first scan (when the item instance transitions from inactive to active/in-transit).
