## Progress Update Meeting 1 - 2025/09/07

> AI generated based on audio recording, and then manually edited

- *Recording*: https://audio.com/edgrant/audio/despro-meeting-1
- *Attendees*: Edgrant, Haris, Other participants
- *Topic*: Project Planning and Technical Discussion for Despro Project
- *Summary*: The meeting covered current development progress on QR scanning, front-end and back-end architectural decisions for Next.js, a discussion on necessary hardware (QR scanner, printer), an project timeline split into phases, and strategies for task division and parallel work. Key decisions were made regarding API structure and initial tasks for the first two weeks.

- *Discussion Points*
  - **Current Development Progress & Front-End Aspects**
    - The team reported successful implementation of QR scanning to capture images and convert them to Base64 format.
    - The Base64 string can already be converted into text.
    - A significant challenge remains in converting the Base64 string into JSON format for database upload.
    - There is exploration into finding a method to directly convert QR code scans into JSON, which would be more efficient.
    - The front-end dev is also responsible for building the UI and connecting to APIs.
    - Initial front-end tasks for Phase 1 include developing the login page and the QR scan page.

  - **Back-End Architecture & API Design**
    - The project uses Next.js, where pages are `page.tsx` files and APIs are typically handled via `route.ts` files.
    - A best practice for processing QR code strings is to use a dedicated back-end API route designed to receive the string and handle database operations (e.g., uploading JSON).
    - There was a discussion on whether to create helper functions within a page's API or to establish dedicated API routes with their own URLs for complex logic.
    - The consensus was to create **specific API routes** with URLs for functions like receiving QR strings and processing them, rather than embedding helper functions directly within a page's API handler. This approach allows for external calls and better task division.
    - For a full-stack framework like Next.js, both front-end and back-end can reside in the same repository.
    - Front-end components will call these internal APIs, passing necessary data (e.g., the scanned string).
    - Phase 1 back-end tasks include creating APIs for login (returning node information) and handling the QR scan string (processing, removing/adding items from database).
    - The initial database schema needs to include `item`, `node`, `user`, `transit`, `item type`, and `item instance` tables, which can be hardcoded initially if not fully implemented.
    - An admin dashboard UI is planned for a later phase.

  - **Hardware Requirements & Integration**
    - The possibility of using a phone camera as the "hardware" was discussed, but the preference is for a dedicated physical hardware component.
    - NFC was suggested as an alternative to QR scanning, though experience with it is limited.
    - The team decided to explore acquiring both a **QR scanner** and a **printer** (for QR code generation) to fulfill the hardware requirement.
    - The budget for hardware is IDR 2,000,000, and a method for reimbursement will be established.
    - It's crucial that the hardware can be **controlled and integrated with code** (e.g., through APIs) rather than relying on a separate application.
    - Barcode scanners typically integrate easily by acting as keyboard input, and it needs to be confirmed if QR code scanners function similarly.

  - **Project Scope, Goals & Timeline**
    - The team debated whether to aim for a basic "pass" or a "good" project suitable for a portfolio, ultimately deciding to aim for a **high-quality project**.
    - The project timeline is set for **3 months** (September, October, November), with a workshop in October, leaving 12 weeks for development.
    - **Phase 1 (Week 1-2, by end of September):**
        - Hardcode two nodes and two users for initial testing.
        - Test QR scanning to ensure item modification (remove/add) works.
        - Develop login page and QR scan page (front-end).
        - Create core database tables: `item`, `node`, `user`, `transit`, `item type`, `item instance` (can be hardcoded if necessary).
        - Develop backend APIs for login and handling scan strings.
    - **Phase 2 (Week 3):**
        - Implement QR code generation.
        - Integrate the hardware.
    - **Phase 3:**
        - Implement user and node creation.
        - Develop transit management features.
        - Ensure user login correctly validates against the appropriate node.
    - **Phase 4:**
        - To be planned.
    - The plan aims for project completion by mid-November, followed by reviewing and additional features.

  - **Team Workflow & Task Division**
    - To facilitate parallel work and clear responsibilities, the team decided to **separate front-end UI development from back-end logic**.
    - Front-end developers will focus on UI and calling APIs, while back-end developers will handle the logic and database interactions.
    - Complex processing, like handling QR scan strings and updating multiple tables, will be encapsulated in dedicated API routes.
    - This division ensures that tasks are assigned per file or module, preventing multiple people from working on the same file and simplifying task allocation for reporting purposes.
    - The front-end can proceed with calling internal APIs, assuming they will work, allowing parallel development while the back-end APIs are being developed.

## Progress Update Meeting 2 - 2025/09/14

- *Recording*: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IrVAhSz-JMxCaXaoHoIXfOkRtuY742MD/view?usp=drive_link
- *Attendees*: Edgrant, Haris, Nadhif, Bima
- *Topic*: Progress Review (Fase 1), Hardware Procurement Strategy, Development Strategy, and Timeline Adjustment.
- *Summary*: The team reviewed initial progress on hardware selection for the QR scanner and addressed the difficulty in sourcing a suitable printer. Development tasks for Phase 1 (Login and QR Scan) were finalized and assigned. A critical discussion on Git branching strategy ensued, recommending individual branches to avoid conflicts. The development target date of the Oktober 17th was maintained, but a buffer period until the 19th was added for testing.

- *Discussion Points*
  - **Hardware Procurement and Functionality**
    - The QR scanner hardware has been identified and is priced at Rp 540k.
    - This scanner connects to a computer via a cable and can read the barcode/QR code directly, similar to systems used in locations like Partek.
    - Difficulty remains in finding a suitable printer, especially one that can convert a code into a printable barcode/QR code.
    - Most available options are currently only portable printers.
    - The requirement for the printer is primarily to print the QR code image itself, preferably using a sticker printer. The hardware requirement is intended to be simple, serving mainly to fulfill project requirements.
    - The QR scanner has not yet been ordered, as the team needs to follow up with the seller for more detailed questions.
    - Searching for specific hardware that links to local vendors (like Shopee or Tokped) is challenging; searches often return only the series number or lead to foreign commerce sites.
  - **Phase 1 Development and Git Strategy**
    - Stage 1 development focuses on completing the **Login** and **Scan** functionalities.
    - Figma designs are mostly complete, though a few parts are still unfinished.
    - When cloning the repository, developers must ensure they are working on the `phase-1` branch, rather than the `main` branch, to avoid errors.
    - To prevent conflicts or issues requiring constant pulling, Haris and Nadhif are advised to create their own feature branches, cloning from `phase-1`.
  - **Task Allocation and User Roles**
    - **Nadhif** is assigned the Front-End (FE) and Back-End (BE) implementation for the **Login** functionality.
    - **Haris** (Ris) is assigned the Front-End (FE) and Back-End (BE) implementation for the **QR Scan** functionality.
    - **Nadhif** needs to explore **Supabase**, as the login system published uses `out user ID`.
      - The login process must accommodate three user types: Petugas, Admin Node, and Admin Pusat
      - The user database table currently only stores role data and node data.
      - A decision must be made whether to implement detailed privilege levels or simplify roles into general categories (e.g., *petugas admin*, *note*, and *admin pusat*).
  - **Timeline and Scheduling**
    - The development target completion date remains the **17th**.
    - A buffer period is added until the **19th** to ensure adequate time for testing before the subsequent meeting review, aiming for a completed Phase 1.

- *Action Items*:
  - Nadhif:
    - [ ] Work on the FE and BE implementation for the **Login** functionality.
    - [ ] Explore and familiarize self with **Supabase**, specifically concerning the login mechanism.
    - [ ] Create a separate branch for feature development, checked out from `phase-1`.
  - Haris:
    - [ ] Work on the FE and BE implementation for the **QR Scan** functionality.
    - [ ] Continue searching online for references/implementations of similar systems, particularly focusing on Indonesian server resources.
    - [ ] Create a separate branch for feature development, checked out from `phase-1`.
  - Bima
    - [ ] Follow up with the seller to confirm detailed specifications and mechanism of the QR scanner connection before placing an order.
    - [ ] Search for a suitable printer (preferably a sticker printer) capable of printing basic QR codes.
  - Development Team
    - [ ] Ensure development targets Phase 1 completion by the **17th**.
    - [ ] Determine the final structure for user privileges (detailed vs. general roles).

## Progress Update Meeting 3 - 2025/09/21

- *Recording*: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qSMf3u4plE5czovOfV2_Hb1tA1iX0Sth/view?usp=sharing
- *Attendees*: Edgrant, Haris, Bima, and Nadhif
- *Topic*: Login & Authentication Progress, QR Scan API Implementation Flow, Hardware Procurement Status, and Next Steps.
- *Summary*: The team reviewed the progress on the Login page authentication, which uses Supabase but relies on a separate `user` table for role and node management. A significant portion of the meeting defined the complex logic for the QR Scan function, focusing on the `item transit` flow, where scanning dictates whether an item is being sent (creating a new active transit record) or received (soft-deleting/inactivating an active transit record). Bima updated the team on the hardware (scanner and printer), pending approval from Pak Alfan. The overall project timeline was shifted back by one week, and the next meeting with Pak Alfan is tentatively planned for the first two weeks of October.

- *Discussion Points*
  - **Login Page & Authentication**
    - The front-end (FE) progress for the login page is complete, although the visual styling is not finalized.
    - _Authentication utilizes Supabase, but the system should not rely solely on Supabase for user role and node management._
    - Supabase is used primarily for verifying email and password validity.
    - **User Role and Node Data:** Crucial user data, specifically the assigned node (`node ID`) and role (e.g., 'petugas' or 'admin'), is stored in a separate `user` table.
    - **Login Flow:** After Supabase verifies the credentials, the backend queries the `user` table to retrieve the associated Node ID and Role.
    - _**Table Structure:** Currently there is no roles column in the `user` table, there is many boolean columns indicating privileges. For simplicity, Edgrant suggested having a single `role` column with values like 'petugas' or 'admin'._
    - The `user ID` in the custom `user` table must correspond exactly to the `user ID` generated by Supabase authentication. It was suggested to remove unnecessary fields from the custom table.
    - **Security Note:** While a best practice is to separate admin and regular user tables to mitigate risk if a user table is breached, this refinement is deferred until the project's end if time permits, and currently, all data is combined.

  - **QR Scan Implementation & API Flow**
    - **FE Progress (Haris):** Haris has successfully developed the front-end to scan a QR code, _When scanned, a string formatted as JSON can be sent_. The system can parse this string into a JSON object ready for transmission to the API. He noted that a separate base URL was not required, as the QR code itself directly holds the JSON string.
    - **API Design:** The team decided that processing should be handled primarily through one endpoint (`QR code data`) which analyzes the data in the string to determine if an item is being sent or received.
    - **Core API Structure:** Basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) APIs exist for core objects: `Node`, `Item Type`, `Item Instance`, and `Transit`.
    - **Item Instance vs. Item Transit:** An `Item Instance` refers to a specific physical item (e.g., one box of Indomie goreng). An `Item Transit` records the movement of an item instance between nodes (source node and destination node).
    - **Item Transit Flow Logic:**
      - The item movement is tracked across four main steps: departing the warehouse, arriving at the kitchen, departing the kitchen, and arriving at the school.
      - Scanning an item requires checking the `item transit` table for any *active* transit record associated with that item instance.
      - **If Active Transit Exists:** Scanning means the item has arrived at the destination node, and the transit record must be made *inactive* (soft delete).
      - **If No Active Transit Exists:** Scanning means the item is being sent (e.g., from the gudang), and a *new* transit record must be created, setting its status to *active*.
      - **New Movements:** Every movement of an item from one node to the next (even if it's the same item instance) requires creating a **new** item transit record.
      - **Item Processing:** If an item is fundamentally changed (e.g., raw ingredients become cooked meals), it becomes a different `item instance`.
      - **Data Preservation:** Deactivating a transit record (upon arrival) is done using a soft delete mechanism to ensure historical data is retained.
      - Error Handling: _Implement error handling can be done to verify that the item instance exists in the database. This is a lower priority task and can be deferred if time is limited._

  - **Hardware Procurement Status**
    - _Bima has found but not purchased the equipment, pending approval after consultation with Pak Alfan._
    - **QR/Barcode Scanner:** Estimated cost is 600,000 IDR. It can scan QR codes but only outputs the raw number or string, which is ideal for integration with QR scanning FE on a laptop. 
    - **Printer:** Recommended printer costs 850,000 IDR. It uses thermal printing (inkless) and can connect via Bluetooth. The layout can be customized via the 'label app'.
    - **Printer Capabilities:** The printer cannot be controlled via code; it only receives print jobs.
    - Total estimated cost for both items is approximately 1.3 million IDR.

  - **Timeline and Next Steps**
    - The overall project timeline has been moved back by one week.
    - Internal meetings will be held every Sunday.
    - A meeting with Pak Alfan is planned for two weeks later (tentatively between October 6th and 10th) to discuss the purchase of hardware.
      - _After meeting notes: Online Meeting is scheduled for October 8th at 16:00 WIB_

- *Action Items*:
  - Nadhif:
    - [ ] Refine the `user` table structure to align `user ID` with Supabase authentication and remove redundant columns.
  - Haris:
    - [ ] Develop the backend API logic for QR scanning, ensuring correct identification of sending (creating active transit) or receiving (soft-deleting/inactivating active transit) based on item transit status.
  - Edgrant:
    - [x] Coordinate and schedule the online meeting with Pak Alfan (targeting early October) to discuss hardware procurement.
  - Bima:
    - [ ] Prepare for the meeting with Pak Alfan to discuss and finalize the hardware purchases (scanner and printer).
